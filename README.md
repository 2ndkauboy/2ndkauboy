# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bernhard, a developer based in Berlin, Germany. My main focus is WordPress development. Besides working full time for a web agency, I regularly write on [my personal blog](https://kau-boys.com) about WordPress and other related topics.

In 2009, I've written my first WordPress plugin and published it into the repository. I have published many more since, always free of cost, to give back to the community. I'm also part of the [pluginkollektiv](https://github.com/pluginkollektiv) maintaining some popular and widely used free plugins.

When I'm not writing code, I help organize community events such as the local [WP Meetup Berlin](https://wpmeetup-berlin.de) or [WordCamp Europe](https://europe.wordcamp.org).

I'm [open for sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/2ndkauboy). Your sponsorship would help me to cover hosting cost for my blog as well as travelling costs to organize events and enable me to volunteer more time contributing to the WordPress community.
